# Retail-Sales-Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis performed in Excel on a US Retail Store's data.
The dataset contains information on products across three categories: 
- Office Supplies
- Technology
- Furniture    

It also contains features such as order and customer IDs, order and shipping dates, customer name, segment and location, etc.

### Data Preparation:
- The ID columns were converted to text
- The dates were converted from text to dates
- The customer names were properly formatted
- The location was split into city, state and country
- The sales and profit columns were converted to currency
- The quantity was converted to an integer and the discount to a float

### Analysis:
- Pivot tables were utilized to summarize the data based on certain criteria
- This made it possible for comparisons to made and patterns/trends to be observed
- Charts were created as per the generated pivot tables

The analysis depicts which region generated the most sales and profits, as well as taxes.
It also showed the most profitable states and product categories.
The sales over the years was also visualized for insights.
